## Quick Start

#### Create a Gatsby site

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the Ck gatsby starter.

```sh
# Create a new Gatsby blog site using the Ck blog gatsby starter
gatsby new <project-name> https://github.com/Ckbhatia/Ck-gatsby-blog
```

#### Start Developing

Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

```sh
cd blog
gatsby develop
```

#### Open the source code and start editing!

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

#### Access Locally
```
$ git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
$ cd [REPO_NAME]
$ yarn
$ npm run develop
```
